# Product Review Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment (Positive, Negative, and Neutral) of various product reviews using machine learning models and different text embedding techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Implemented multiple text embeddings: **Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and GloVe**.
- Built sentiment classifiers using **Random Forest**.
- Trained on both balanced and unbalanced datasets.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.
